Colors and Typography

In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to improve a vibrant, color-rich web page for a home paint business. It displays information about using color in a home and color swatches with varying lightness, saturation, and hue.

The page is almost ready to be published. Youâ€™ll be making the following color-related changes:

* Exchange some named colors with hexadecimal color values.
* Add some semi-transparent overlays to the banner and footer using RGBA.
* Fill in the first color column of the swatch samples using HSL colors.

- [x] In style.css, find the three CSS rules that use the named color orange. This color is not exactly the right orange to match the paint store brand. Replace orange with the hex color #ff8000.
    * The first place of `orange` is the background of the header, under the selector `header`.
